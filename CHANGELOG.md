# Changelog

All notable changes to this project are documented here. The format follows
[Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/), and the project uses
[Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/).

## [0.4.1] - 2026-10-18

- Add a `secrets` configuration section for cloud storage: AWS S3 and S3-compatible
  services (Cloudflare R2, MinIO, Wasabi, GCS interoperability) and Azure Blob/ADLS,
  with static keys or the platform credential chain. Secrets apply to DuckDB reads and
  to remote Parquet read through Polars, and are masked in reports and logs.
- Mask `key_id`, `connection_string`, account keys and SAS tokens wherever settings
  or messages are redacted.
- Include the `aws` and `azure` DuckDB extensions in the container image.
- Never stop an isolated worker before its wall-time deadline: on Windows a process
  wait could wake a few nanoseconds early and end the worker before its allowance.

## [0.4.0] - 2026-10-18

First public release.

- Validation API (`validate`, `QARunner`) and CLI for files, globs, URLs, databases,
  SQL queries, Polars/pandas/Arrow frames and Python loaders.
- 28 built-in rules: input contracts, column limits, keys and foreign keys, row
  expressions and SQL assertions, freshness, temporal and spatial checks, outlier and
  drift detection, reconciliation and regression against accepted baselines.
- Fail-closed assessment: checks that cannot be assessed make a run incomplete rather
  than passing, with exact counts and bounded, deterministic evidence.
- HTML and JSON reports with full run provenance and redacted credentials.
- Resource budgets for memory, spill storage, evidence and report size, and optional
  isolated execution with OS-enforced limits on Linux, macOS and Windows.
- Plugin discovery for rules and sources from packages, files and entry points.
