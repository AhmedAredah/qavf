[Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/).

## [0.5.0] - 2026-10-23

### Added

- **Dataset comparison.** `compare_datasets`, the `CMP-001` rule and
  `qavf compare-datasets` compare a candidate dataset with a baseline, including
  datasets whose columns differ. An alignment pipeline handles this: column mapping,
  lossless casts, unit scaling, recoding, derived columns, filters, time shifts and
  zone assignment. Comparison levels: structure, key coverage, keyed records,
  grouped measures, temporal buckets and series shape, spatial zones and locations,
  distributions, relationships and contributions (with an exact mix-versus-rate
  decomposition). Checks that cannot be assessed are reported as such, never passed.
- **Statistical inference.** `qavf.inference` provides paired, independent-sample,
  equivalence, categorical, count, trend and spatial tests, multiple-testing
  corrections, intervals, bootstraps, effect sizes and agreement metrics. By default
  a comparison fails only when a difference is both material and significant after
  Benjamini-Hochberg correction. TMP-002, TMP-003 and STA-002 use the same tests
  and report `p_value`, `adjusted_p` and `effect`.
- **Spatial building blocks** (`qavf.spatial`). Zone layers come from datasets,
  GeoParquet, GeoJSON or shapefiles. Point-to-zone assignment has explicit boundary
  and overlap policies. Also grids, crosswalks, hierarchies, neighbour weights,
  Moran's I and LISA. GEO-001 accepts a `within` zone layer and SPA-003 a
  `zone_layer`. Geometry needs DuckDB's `spatial` extension.
- **Temporal building blocks** (`qavf.temporal`, `qavf.statistics.series`).
  Calendar buckets follow local time zones and keep DST days intact. TMP-001 to
  TMP-008 accept `bucket`, `time_zone` and `time_format` for Date, Datetime and
  text time columns.
- Reports show a comparison section: a summary, per-check evidence and inline SVG
  charts within `HtmlLimits`. `DatasetComparison` can write its own HTML and JSON
  reports.
- Regression comparisons map renamed columns (`column_map=`, `rename`,
  `qavf compare --map OLD=NEW`).
- A new `spatial` extra (pyproj and SciPy) adds indexed neighbour searches and
  authoritative CRS resolution. `all` now includes it.
- Alignment steps, measures, comparators, levels and statistical tests are
  pluggable through registration decorators and entry points. The shared component
  registry lives in `qavf.plugins.registry`.

### Changed

- Fewer false passes: invalid or empty assessments, unsupported numeric values,
  lossy casts, undefined statistics and duplicate keys are now failures or
  explicitly unassessed. Some verdicts that were wrongly passing will change.
- New default resource limits, with explicit refusal instead of partial results:
  - polygon assignment: 1,000,000 point keys, 2,000,000 mappings, 20,000,000
    candidate pairs;
  - neighbour graphs: 1,000,000 edges;
  - profiling category state: 1 MiB.

  Raise these deliberately for larger workloads.
- Unknown CRS classifications need `qavf[spatial]`. The minimum supported pyproj
  is 3.6.1.
- Invalid fractional byte sizes are rejected rather than rounded. Colliding HTML and
  JSON report paths are refused before writing (CLI exit code 2). Typed Parquet
  reads refuse explicit cloud credential-provider chains.
- A core install without the `stats` extra should set `decision: material` for
  comparisons.

### Performance

- Neighbour weights use compact sparse arrays.
- Point-to-zone matching runs in batches, resolving overlaps natively.
- Map outlines are checked against their vertex budget before they are built.
- Compatible lazy column checks are evaluated in one scan.
- Rule provenance no longer scans every installed package.
- Fewer redundant source evaluations and serializations, plus bounded work for
  resampling, correlations, graphs and reports.

### Fixed

- Exact numeric handling: Int128 scaling, Decimal rounding, nanosecond and missing
  group identities, subnormal ratios and floating-point threshold boundaries.
- Statistics: BCa acceleration, contingency counts, resampling stability, DST bucket
  grids and dependent time ordering.
- Execution: deadline monitoring through cleanup, cancellation at native operation
  entry, plugin registration atomicity and retained-memory accounting.
- Compatibility with the minimum supported Polars and DuckDB versions.

## [0.4.1] - 2026-10-18

- Add a `secrets` configuration section for cloud storage: AWS S3 and S3-compatible
  services (Cloudflare R2, MinIO, Wasabi, GCS interoperability) and Azure Blob/ADLS,
  with static keys or the platform credential chain. Secrets apply to DuckDB reads and
  to remote Parquet read through Polars, and are masked in reports and logs.
- Mask `key_id`, `connection_string`, account keys and SAS tokens wherever settings
  or messages are redacted.
- Include the `aws` and `azure` DuckDB extensions in the container image.
- Never stop an isolated worker before its wall-time deadline: on Windows a process
  wait could wake a few nanoseconds early and end the worker before its allowance.

## [0.4.0] - 2026-10-18

First public release.

- Validation API (`validate`, `QARunner`) and CLI for files, globs, URLs, databases,
  SQL queries, Polars/pandas/Arrow frames and Python loaders.
- 28 built-in rules: input contracts, column limits, keys and foreign keys, row
  expressions and SQL assertions, freshness, temporal and spatial checks, outlier and
  drift detection, reconciliation and regression against accepted baselines.
- Fail-closed assessment: checks that cannot be assessed make a run incomplete rather
  than passing, with exact counts and bounded, deterministic evidence.
- HTML and JSON reports with full run provenance and redacted credentials.
- Resource budgets for memory, spill storage, evidence and report size, and optional
  isolated execution with OS-enforced limits on Linux, macOS and Windows.
- Plugin discovery for rules and sources from packages, files and entry points.
